eZ Tika is an extension that enables a handler for converting multiple binary file formats to plain text as used
by the search engine (if you enabled those attributes as searcheable).

Currently, most common office formats are enabled (see also binaryfile.ini.append.php):

[application/pdf]
[application/msword]
[application/vnd.ms-excel]
[application/vnd.ms-powerpoint]
[application/vnd.visio]
[application/vnd.ms-outlook]
